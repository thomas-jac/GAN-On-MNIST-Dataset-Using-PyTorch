# GAN-On-MNIST-Dataset
This is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize new images similar to the ones in the original MNIST dataset. The model consists of a discriminator which was trained on the images of the MNIST dataset. Fairly satisfactory results are obtained on training the network for 25 epochs, although much better results could be obtained with longer training times. Refer to the .ipynb file for additional details on the implementation and the respective results obtained.
